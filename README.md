Environmental Monitoring and Sensor Storage (EnMaSSe) - Funded by ANDS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There have been great strides in making it easier to share and re-use research data throughout Australia, and EnMaSSe is a tool that takes it one step further.  EnMaSSe is designed to increase the efficiency of creating and sharing research data, which means quicker progress within Australia as a whole, higher potential for new technologies and a better understanding of our environment.

Think of research data as information scientists & engineers have available for creating new technologies such as mapping how climate change will affect your life in the next 30 years, the latest medical cures or preserving our great Australian environment - almost anything you can think of, the building blocks of our entire modern lifestyle is research!

The EnMaSSe application provides a user-friendly interface for:
Flexible and scalable research data ingestion (both streamed or manually input).
High quality, fine grained, project based, metadata creation and export (eg. Enter 1 record, export many).
Administerable and maintainable project lifecycle and workflows.
