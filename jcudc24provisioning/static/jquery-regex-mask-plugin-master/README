This plugin will perform mask validation based on an arbitrary regular
expression. It will take the current input value, plus the incoming
character in the keydown event and test against the provided regex to
assert if the incoming character should be accepted or not.

In terms, it is a bit alike the keyfilter plugin, but it tests the
incoming character in the context of the whole string.

USAGE:

  $('.float').regexMask(/^\d+(,\d+)?$/);

or you can use one of the named masks, which include:

  float-ptbr
  float-enus
