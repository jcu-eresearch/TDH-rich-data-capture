            There have been great strides in making it easier to share and re-use research data throughout Australia,
            and EnMaSSe is a tool that takes it one step further. EnMaSSe is designed to increase the efficiency of
            creating and sharing research data, which means quicker progress within Australia as a whole, higher
            potential for new technologies and a better understanding of our environment.

            The important outcomes of the EnMaSSE system are both:
            <ul>
                <li>High quality information about the data (metadata) describing why it is important and good quality.</li>
                <li>Ingesting the actual data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The figure illustrates how external sensors and manual observations are input into EnMaSSe along with
                the high quality information about the ingested data which is then exported to external systems for
                persistent storage and publication.
            </p>
            <p>
                Research Data Australia (RDA) is a national service for publication and sharing of research data, this
                is the destination for the high quality information about the collected data.
            </p>

                ReDBox-Mint is 3rd party metadata repository (ReDBox) and name authority (Mint) which stores people,
                grants/activities and services. ReDBox handles curation (quality assurance and linking related
                information) and exporting to RDA.

                CoastalCOMS Digital Asset Manager CC-DAM is the persistent data storage system used, to put it simply
                it is a database indexed file storage system which makes it highly scalable (for example our first
                import contained over 8 million files!).
            </p>
            <p>
                Sensor data presents the most obvious example of data that is challenging for researchers to share: many
                datasets are collected at many locations sometimes with multiple sensor types often across multiple
                projects. Yet almost all metadata for a single sensor for a single project will be the same, and often the
                metadata between projects will be similar. EnMaSSe recognises this and is structured such that a single
                unique piece of information should rarely need to be typed more than once (Figure 2).

                    <h2>What</h2>
                    <p>The EnMaSSe application is designed to provide a user friendly interface for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flexible and scalable research data ingestion (both streamed or manually input).</li>
                        <li>High quality, fine grained, project based, metadata creation and export (eg. Enter 1 record, export many).</li>

                    <h2>Why</h2>
                    <p>The real power and reusability of the EnMaSSe is directly streaming sensor data into a scalable data storage system in a highly flexible way:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reusable and extendable for almost any type of streaming sensor.</li>
                        <li>Highly customisable data configurations and custom processing scripts mean the data storage can index the ingested data any way the user requires while the bulk of data is stored as flat files (more scalable).</li>
                        <li>Custom processing scripts can be chained together allowing the data to be split and processed in many ways.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="desc">
                    <h2>How</h2>
                    <p>The project creation workflow collects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Information required for quality metadata records</li>
                        <li>Data ingestion configurations.</li>
                        <li>Actual datasets or points of data.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once the configurations are entered and the project is submitted and approved, the project generates and exports a metadata record for each dataset as well as configuring and starting data ingestion.</p>
