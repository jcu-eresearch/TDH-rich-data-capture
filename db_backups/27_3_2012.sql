Traps were cleared monthly from 2006 to 2009. Samples are stored in ethanol at JCU. \r\n\r\nMalaise traps: \r\nAn open-sided tent with a central vertical panel that reaches down to the ground was erected. Fast-flying insects, such as flies and wasps, hit the central panel and fly upwards towards a sloping roof that directs them towards a collecting chamber at the high end of the trap. Propylene glycol was used as a preservative in the collecting chamber. Traps were cleared monthly from 2006 to 2009. Samples are stored in ethanol at JCU. \r\n\r\nInsect pitfall traps (2006-2010): \r\nSix pitfall traps at 200 m intervals were placed along a 1 km transect at each altitude, (sites are consistent with previous research by Williams et al). Pitfall traps consisted of two round plastic take away containers (11 cm diameter) placed inside each other. Dung was wrapped in \"chux\" table wipes and hung on top of the trap using wooden barbeque skewers. 150 ml of Formalin (4% phosphate buffered formaldehyde) was used as a killing agent and preservative in each trap. A metal \"cage\" (bathroom soap holder) was placed around each pitfall trap and pinned to the ground. A metal plate covered the cage acting as rain guard. Specimens were brought back to JCU. \r\n- A minimal amount of preservative (150 ml per trap) was used. \r\n- A cover will prevent rainfall from entering the trap thus preventing overspilling of the preservative. \r\n- Traps will be placed on slightly higher ground or on a natural or artificial mound so as to prevent surface runoff from entering the trap thus avoiding overspilling of the preservative. \r\n- A metal \"cage\" (bathroom soap holder) will be placed around each pitfall trap and pinned to the ground. The gaps on the cage are 12 mm x 12 mm.

Williams, unpublished data).','form_data_source',NULL),(7,25,NULL,'Invertebrate sampling','Insects were sampled using a combination of Malaise traps, pitfall traps, and flight intercept traps (FIT) at this permanent site.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlight intercept traps: \r\nA vertical screen of transparent plastic was stretched between two stakes, and a trough containing preservative fluid (propylene glycol) was arranged below its bottom edge. Traps were cleared monthly from 2006 to 2009. Samples are stored in ethanol at JCU. \r\n\r\nMalaise traps: \r\nAn open-sided tent with a central vertical panel that reaches down to the ground was erected. Fast-flying insects, such as flies and wasps, hit the central panel and fly upwards towards a sloping roof that directs them towards a collecting chamber at the high end of the trap. Propylene glycol was used as a preservative in the collecting chamber. Traps were cleared monthly from 2006 to 2009. Samples are stored in ethanol at JCU. \r\n\r\nInsect pitfall traps (2006-2010): \r\nSix pitfall traps at 200 m intervals were placed along a 1 km transect at each altitude, (sites are consistent with previous research by Williams et al). Pitfall traps consisted of two round plastic take away containers (11 cm diameter) placed inside each other. Dung was wrapped in \"chux\" table wipes and hung on top of the trap using wooden barbeque skewers. 150 ml of Formalin (4% phosphate buffered formaldehyde) was used as a killing agent and preservative in each trap. A metal \"cage\" (bathroom soap holder) was placed around each pitfall trap and pinned to the ground. A metal plate covered the cage acting as rain guard. Specimens were brought back to JCU. \r\n- A minimal amount of preservative (150 ml per trap) was used. \r\n- A cover will prevent rainfall from entering the trap thus preventing overspilling of the preservative. \r\n- Traps will be placed on slightly higher ground or on a natural or artificial mound so as to prevent surface runoff from entering the trap thus avoiding overspilling of the preservative. \r\n- A metal \"cage\" (bathroom soap holder) will be placed around each pitfall trap and pinned to the ground. The gaps on the cage are 12 mm x 12 mm. This will allow dung beetles to be trapped and at the same time exclude all mammals and the majority of reptiles from accidentally falling in the trap. \r\n- Vertebrates are also repelled by formalin so there is no risk of them interfering with the trap. Many scientists even add formalin to other trap types so as to avoid vertebrate interference. \r\n- Ethics has been approved under A1120','form_data_source',NULL),(6,26,NULL,'HOBO Data logger',NULL,'form_data_source',NULL),(5,6,1,NULL,NULL,'form_data_source',NULL),(9,34,NULL,'Reptile Surveys (Miscellaneous)',NULL,'form_data_source',NULL),(9,37,NULL,'Reptile Surveys (Miscellaneous)',NULL,'form_data_source',NULL),(11,40,NULL,'Microhylid survey (Miscellaneous)',NULL,'form_data_source',NULL),(9,86,NULL,'Reptile Surveys (Standard)',NULL,'form_data_source',NULL),(9,42,NULL,'Reptile Surveys (Standard)',NULL,'form_data_source',NULL),(9,46,NULL,'Reptile Surveys (Standard)',NULL,'form_data_source',NULL),(10,47,NULL,'Mammal survey - spotlighting (Standard)',NULL,'form_data_source',NULL),(9,48,NULL,'Reptile Surveys (Miscellaneous)',NULL,'form_data_source',NULL),(10,27,1,'Mammal survey - spotlighting','Nocturnal visual counts of mammals were made in 1,000m spotlighting transects along old unused logging tracks, with 1 h of search effort, using a combination of one observer with a 30W handheld spotlight and another observer with a low-power head torch.
