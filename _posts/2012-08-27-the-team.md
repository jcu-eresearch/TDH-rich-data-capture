    <h2>Marianne Brown</h2>
    <h3>Project Manager</h3>
    <p>
    Marianne has worked in the IT industry since 1994 in a variety of roles
    from research programmer, university lecturer, software engineer and
    systems analyst and designer. She has been employed at the eResearch Centre
    at James Cook University since 2009, working on various web application
    projects and has been involved in several ANDS/QCIF funded projects: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>EIF046 - Tropical Data Hub Portal</i> - created a Plone product
        to add a simple metadata repository to a Plone site. <br>
        The code and documentation is available from the <a
            href="http://jcu-eresearch.github.com/tdh.metadata">github
            site</a>.</li>
        <li><i>SC23 - Tropical Data Hub Collection Discovery and Description</i>
        - this project's aim was to use the system developed in EIF046 to enter
        metadata records for JCU research data and have these harvested by ANDS
        for publication on <a href="http://services.ands.org.au/">Research 
        Data Australia</a>. By the end of the project, 68 collection records had
        been collected and published.
        </li>
        <li><i>AP03: Edgar - Australian Bird Species Distribution Now and in the Future</i> -
        this project build a website to view and vet bird observation records from the 
        <a href="http://www.ala.org.au/">Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)</a> and use these vetted records
        as input to distribution modelling algorithms to generate current and projected future distributions.
        Production site can be found at <a href="http://tropicaldatahub.org/goto/Edgar">
        http://tropicaldatahub.org/goto/Edgar</a>,
        code can be found at the <a href="http://github.com/jcu-eresearch/Edgar">GitHub site</a> and
        there is a <a href="http://jcu-eresearch.github.com/Edgar">documentation and developers blog site</a>
        for more informaiton about the project.
        </li>
