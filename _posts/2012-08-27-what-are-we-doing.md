<p>This project will produce an easy to use provisioning tool for configuring, storing and publishing research data and its associated metadata.  The overall system will be based on the <a href="http://www.coastalcoms.com/">CoastalCOMS</a> Data Access Management (CC-DAM) system and <a href="www.jcu.edu.au/">James Cool University's (JCU)</a>  <a href="http://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/">ReDBox-Mint</a> metadata repository.</p>

<p>ingesters will be developed to receive data from a number of different types of data streams, process these streams and feed the data to the CC-DAM:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Video</li>
    <li>Acoustic</li>
    <li>Sensor data â€“ for a variety of sensor types</li>
    <li>Field observations</li>
</ul>

<p>
The CC-DAM can be searched and downloaded via a web-based interface and The <a href="https://eresearch.jcu.edu.au/tdh">Tropical Data Hub (TDH)</a> is a proposed platform to serve data sets related to tropical research from a single virtual location and will include data-integration, visualisation and analytical tools to enable researchers, managers and decision-makers to collaborate around the data.
</p>

<p>The finished project will be great for researchers because:
<ul>
	<li>Single, centralised storage service that can be configured for all of their research data needs.</li>
	<li>Easy to use interface for providing all of the related metadata for their project.  This effectively allows the researcher to describe who, what, when, where and why their research was done as well as providing accurate details.</li>
	<li>Their research will be published nationally through <a href="http://www.ands.org.au/">ANDS</a> <a href="http://researchdata.ands.org.au/">Research Data Australia (RDA)</a>.  This gives an increased chance for re-use and recognition of their work.</li>
	<li>New software allowing researchers to directly stream sensor data instead of manually retreiving and uploading data from sensors (sometimes numerous and widely dispersed)</li>
	<li>A national repository to search for well documented, easily reusable research data.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
All components developed will be available from this github along with developer and user documentation.
