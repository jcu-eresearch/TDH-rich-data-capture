<p>This project will produce an easy to use provisioning tool for configuring, storing and publishing research data and its associated metadata.  The overall system will be based on the Coastal Comms Data Access Management (CC-DAM) system and JCU’s  ReDBox-Mint metadata repository. </p>

<p>The provisioning system will capture and create collection descriptions for a wide range of data sets out of the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF), Daintree Rainforest Observatory (DRO) facility - a high profile education and research centre, as well as the Wet Tropics World Heritage (WTWH) and the Australian Centre for Tropical Freshwater Research (ACTFR) centres.</p>

<p>Ingestors will be developed to receive data from a number of different types of data streams, process these streams as required and feed the data to the CC-DAM system:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Video streams</li>
    <li>Acoustic streams</li>
    <li>Sensor data – for a variety of sensor types</li>
    <li>Field observations</li>
</ul>
<p>
The CC-DAM can be searched and downloaded via a web-based interface and The Tropical Data Hub (TDH) is a proposed platform to serve data sets related to tropical research from a single virtual location and will include data-integration, visualisation and analytical tools to enable researchers, managers and decision-makers to collaborate around the data.
</p>
<p>
These collections will be made available to researchers via the JCU Tropical Data Hub and will be harvestable via Australian National Data Service’s Research Data Australia System.
</p>
<p>
All components developed will be available from this github along with developer and user documentation.
