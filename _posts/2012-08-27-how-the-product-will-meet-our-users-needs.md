<p><b>Researchers looking to store data</b> will benefit from the availability of a single interface for all their data storage, processing and publishing requirements, ability to easily publish their research nationally thereby providing the opportunity for increased recognition of their work and a structured way to record descriptions, coverage, calibration and other information linked to their research data. </p>

<p><b>Researchers searching for data</b> to reuse will benefit from a standardised system for a wide range of research data thereby making it easier to search.  They will also benefit from increased availability of research data as entry into the system will publish the metadata nationally on Research Data Australia (RDA) and enforcing valid RIF-CS metadata will improve research data descriptions, coverage and reliability information.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.ands.org.au/">Research Data Australia</a></b> will benefit by being populated with research data from numerous projects at JCU and other users of the system.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.jcu.edu.au/ctbcc/">CTBCC</a> and the Australian Wet Tropics research</b> will participate as examples of manual data and sensor feeds and will benefit from customised ingestors and the trasfer of over 60 datasets into the new systems.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://eresearch.jcu.edu.au/projects/semat-1">SEMAT</a> and <a href="http://www.sciencemob.org/">ScienceMob</a></b> will participate as examples for streamed sensor feeds.</p>
