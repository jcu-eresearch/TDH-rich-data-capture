To put it simply this project will provide an easy to use interface to wrap a number of cutting edge technologies together to provide nationally searchable and reusable datasets.  Refer to the figure below for an overview of the primary product.

This software is important because data that is difficult to find or has uncertain reliability prohibits reuse.  By providing a singular, easy to use system that captures, processes and publishes research data and all the relevant metadata (researchers involved, sensor accuracies, data coverage, etc.) on an easy to search, national website it allows researchers to more efficiently build on each others work.

The system is intended to accommodate a wide range of data types allowing new projects to be configured with the minimum of difficulty.  User documentation will be provided outlining how to configure new projects and developer documentation will outline how to create new ingesters.

Documentation will also be provided on how to integrate the developed software into the underlying systems.
