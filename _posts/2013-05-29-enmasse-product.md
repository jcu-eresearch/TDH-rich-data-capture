*Introducing*


EnMaSSe is JCUâ€™s solution to ensuring research data collected from sensors, cameras, and audio records is persistently stored in a sensible format and high quality metadata is collected at the start of research projects.

The EnMaSSe application is designed to provide a user friendly interface for:

* Flexible and scalable research data ingestion (both streamed or manually input);
* High quality, fine grained, project based, metadata creation and export (eg. Enter 1 record, export many); and
* Administerable and maintainable project lifecycle and workflows.


EnMaSSe will ensure that all research data is securely stored and catalogued to ensure it is findable by the research community at large. Metadata records are created for all datasets and stored in the JCU Research Data catalogue which ensures the records are pushed to Research Data Australia.
