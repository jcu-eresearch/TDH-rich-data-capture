*Introducing*

<img src="{{ site.JB.BASE_PATH }}/images/enmasse-logo.png" />

EnMaSSe is JCUâ€™s solution to ensuring research data collected from sensors, cameras, and audio records is persistently stored in a sensible format and high quality metadata is collected at the start of research projects.

The EnMaSSe application is designed to provide a user friendly interface for:

* Flexible and scalable research data ingestion (both streamed or manually input);
* High quality, fine grained, project based, metadata creation and export (eg. Enter 1 record, export many); and
* Administerable and maintainable project lifecycle and workflows.


EnMaSSe will ensure that all research data is securely stored and catalogued to ensure it is findable by the research community at large. Metadata records are created for all datasets and stored in the JCU Research Data catalogue which ensures the records are pushed to Research Data Australia.

### Getting Started

The EnMaSSe system has been designed to enable researchers at James Cook University to easily configure storage space for environmental monitoring experiments. An example case study of the type of project that can be undertaken is details in the Artificial Tree blog posts:

* [Artifical Tree - Overview]({{ site.JB.BASE_PATH}}/2013/01/31/case-study-artificial-tree-overview-part-1) - this post provides the background to the project and what is trying to be achieved.
* [Artifical Tree - Setup]( {{ site.JB.BASE_PATH}}/2013/05/03/case-study-artificial-tree-setup-part-2/) - this post walks you through the use of EnMaSSe to set up the storage ready to recieve the data and to create the metadata records for the datasets created by the Artificial tree.
