<p>The core value of this project is wrapping other well developed technologies into a single system for the end user.  This will allow researchers to provision the storage of data and enter all relevant metadata in a single interface which publishes nationally to <a href="http://researchdata.ands.org.au/">Research Data Australia (RDA)</a>.</p>

<p>One of our key user groups is researchers that are looking for a way to store their data.  These users will be primarily concerned with:
	<ol>
		<li>Ease, speed and stability of using the system.</li>
		<li>Ability to ingest their particular type of data either via manual upload or directly streamed.</li>
		<li>Ability to process their data, how they want it processed, when it is ingested.</li>
		<li>Ability to enter all relevant metadata about their research in an appropriate manner.</li>
		<li>Appropriate workflow for publishing their data nationally on <a href="http://researchdata.ands.org.au/">Research Data Australia (RDA)</a>.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>The first point requires a well-developed, intuitive user interface that allows researchers to easily setup a project with the associated metadata, processors and reporting as well as providing an easy way to add new data to a currently running project.</p>

<p>The second and third points hinge around the flexibility of ingesters and processors written for the <a href="http://www.coastalcoms.com/">CoastalCOMS</a> Data Access Management (CC-DAM) and the ease of implementing new ingesters.  We are gathering information from researchers who use the four data types to find current and foreseeable ingester requirements.</p>

<p>To address the fourth and fifth points our systems interface will require valid <a href="http://www.ands.org.au/guides/content-providers-guide.html">RIF-CS</a> metadata and use <a href="http://www.jcu.edu.au/">James Cook University's (JCU)</a> <a href="http://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/">ReDBox-Mint</a> software to store and publish the metadata.</p>

<p>The other key user group is researchers that are searching for data to use in their own research.  These users will be primarily concerned with:
	<ol>
		<li>Quality of metadata that the system captures</li>
		<li>Ease of searching and accessing data</li>
		<li>Quality of reporting and output methods.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>The first two points will be addressed by using <a href="http://www.jcu.edu.au/">JCU's</a> <a href="http://www.redboxresearchdata.com.au/">ReDBox-Mint</a> system which requires valid <a href="http://www.ands.org.au/guides/content-providers-guide.html">RIF-CS</a> metadata and publishes records nationally on <a href="http://researchdata.ands.org.au/">RDA</a>.</p>

<p>The third point will be addressed by providing well documented methods of querying the CC-DAM system to suit the requirements that <a href="http://www.jcu.edu.au/">JCU</a> researchers can foresee needing.</p>
